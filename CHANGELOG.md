## [1.1.0]
### Changed
- `RestRequestListener` will not try to resolve `RestRequestOptions` on `kernel.request` event after resolving route configuration.

## [1.0.0]
### Changed
- `ErrorNormalizer` does not return keys with `null` values anymore.
This means that you'll get errors like this:

```json
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"Expected non-empty request body"}
```

instead of this:

```json
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"Expected non-empty request body","error_uri":null,"error_properties":null,"error_data":null,"errors":null}
```

## 0.2.1
### Changed
- `paysera/lib-pagination` bumped to `^1.0`

## 0.2.0
### Changed
- since `paysera/lib-normalization` version `1.0` null keys are not filtered.
